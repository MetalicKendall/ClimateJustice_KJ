    <summary>
        <p>The country of Chad in Africa is facing a climate crisis. It is one of the least developed countries in addition to being highly vulnerable to climate change. It experiences periodic droughts, occasional flooding, and locust plagues, and it is considered one of the hottest countries in the world with an average yearly temperature of 79.79°F (26.55°C).</p>

            <h2>Lake Chad Is Drying Up</h2>
            <p>Lake Chad has reduced in size by about 90% due to overuse and temperature increases. It is estimated that in 20 years the lake could completely dry up. With the lake drying, it is becoming harder to have access to clean water.</p>

            <h2>It Is Only Getting Hotter</h2>
            <p>Studies show that the average temperature has already increased by 0.7°C and is estimated to increase by 1-3 degrees by the year 2060.</p>

            <h2>Ill-Prepared For Flooding</h2>
            <p>Chad occasionally floods due to torrential rain and Chad's infrastructure can not handle flooding. It was projected that more than 300,000 people could be affected in 2021.</p>

                <h4>Clean Water</h4>
                <p>Technology can help make clean water easier to access by developing an automated system that can filter out bacteria and other harmful matter. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Lake Overuse</h4>
                <p>People in Chad mainly used the lake for livestock, fishing, and crops. Programmers could develop a system that helps regulate how much of a resource is used and gives accurate amounts on how much of a resource is needed, so no resource gets wasted. </p>

            <div>
                <h4>Reducing Carbon Emissions</h4>
                <p> Governments could invest more in cleaner energy generators. For example, solar panels, or wind turbines would reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere</p>
